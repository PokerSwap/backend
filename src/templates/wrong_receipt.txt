USER UNDERSTANDS THAT SWAP PROFIT DOES NOT GUARANTEE PAYOUTS BETWEEN USERS. SWAP PROFIT IS ONLY FACILITATING SWAPS BY PROVIDING A COMMUNITY MARKETPLACE FOR USERS TO COMMUNICATE, AS WELL AS  WRITTEN AGREEMENTS BETWEEN USERS ONCE A SWAP HAS TAKEN PLACE. SWAP PROFIT IS NOT LIABLE FOR ACTUAL PAYOUTS BETWEEN USERS ONCE A COMPETITION IS COMPLETED AND RESULTS PUBLISHED.  SWAP PROFIT WILL PROVIDE USERS PREFERRED PAYMENT METHODS TO THEIR SWAP PARTNERS AND COMPLETED PAYMENTS BETWEEN USERS WILL BE TRACKED, POSTED TO THEIR PROFILES AND CALCULATED INTO A USER’S SWAP RATING. AFTER A COMPLETED INVESTIGATION, ANY NONPAYMENT ON A CONFIRMED SWAP WILL RESULT IN THE IMMEDIATE TERMINATION OF A USERS ACCOUNT AND SWAP PROFIT WILL COOPERATE IN ANY LEGAL ACTION THE NON-PAID PARTY DECIDES TO PURSUE. SWAP PROFIT AT ITS DISCRETION MAY ALSO REPORT NON-PAYMENT OF SWAPS TO RESPECTIVE INDUSTRY MEDIA OUTLETS SO THAT OTHER PARTICIPANTS ARE AWARE– see our SWAP RATING POLICY.
